Acceess modifiers in Java are keywords added to the declaration of an object that specifies where the object can be accessed from.

1. default ==> This access modifier is the default modifier. You don't have to explicitly write it out when declaring an object.
        In this case, the object, class can be accessed throughout the package (all files in the folder) that the object, class was declared.


2. private ==> Syntax - private class class_name {}, private method method_name {} e.t.c
        In this case, the object, class can  only be accessed in that particular class where it was declared.


3. public ==> Syntax - public class class_name {}, public method method_name {} e.t.c
        In this case, the object, class can  be accessed everywhere.

4. protected ==> Syntax - protected class class_name {}, protected method method_name {} e.t.c
                In this case, the object, class can be accesed in the same package and in a sub-class (where the protected is inherited) in another package.
