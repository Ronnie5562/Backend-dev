# Throws Keyword in Java

The `throws` keyword in Java is an essential part of exception handling, allowing developers to specify and declare exceptions that a method might throw. This declaration is necessary because it informs the caller of the method about the exceptions it needs to handle or propagate further. Here are some key points about the `throws` keyword:

1. **Exception Declaration:** When a method can potentially throw checked exceptions (exceptions that are not subclasses of `RuntimeException`), it must declare them using the `throws` keyword in its method signature.

    ```java
    public void myMethod() throws IOException, InterruptedException {}
        // Method code that can potentially throw IOException or InterruptedException
    ```
2. **Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions:** Checked exceptions must be declared with the `throws` keyword, while unchecked exceptions (subclasses of `RuntimeException`) do not require such declaration.

3. **Propagation:** When a method declares exceptions with `throws`, it can propagate those exceptions to the calling method. This means that the caller is responsible for handling or further declaring these exceptions.

4. **Handling Exceptions:** The caller of a method that declares exceptions with `throws` should either handle the exceptions using `try-catch` blocks or declare them in its own method signature with `throws`.

5. **Example:**

    ```java
    public void callingMethod() {
        try {
            myMethod(); // This method call might throw IOException or InterruptedException
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle the IOException
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            // Handle the InterruptedException
        }
    }
    ```

    **OR**

    ```java
    public void callingMethod() throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        myMethod(); // This method call might throw IOException or InterruptedException
    }
    ```



The `throws` keyword is a crucial part of Java's robust exception handling mechanism, ensuring that exceptions are appropriately documented and managed in a program.
